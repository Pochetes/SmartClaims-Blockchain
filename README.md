# What is SmartClaims?
SmartClaims is a secure and simple way to store claims on an Ethereum blockchain. Through using SmartClaims, Liberty Mutual can leverage the security and scalability that comes with a network of smart contracts.

# How does it work?
SmartClaims operates through the usage of Truffle, MetaMask, Web3.js, and React. 
Truffle is a development environment that serves to build decentralized applications like SmartClaims. MetaMask allows users to easily interact with such applications in a browser. Web3.js is an Ethereum API that allows the backend of SmartClaims to interact with the frontend. Finally, Liberty Mutual customers have the ability to submit claims through a web application built in React. 

# Current Functionalities & Future Development Opportunities
As of right now, LM customers can complete a Auto, Health, or Property claims form through accessing the web application. This information is then securely stored on a blockchain. For the future, SmartClaims will provide the feature of allowing past contracts to be accessed. Smart contracts can not only store data, but also execute transactions without a 3rd party involvement. SmartClaims will take advantage of the autonomous nature of smart contracts to automate claims processing.
